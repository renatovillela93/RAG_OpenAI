       " 'work methods in the context of geoinformation systems (GIS) in planning and design. In order to assess the learning outcome, four workshops with international landscape architecture students at master level were conducted over a period of four years (2018-2021) and compared in a qualitative multiple-case study. In times of Covid-19 and the need for remote workshop methods, the geodesign workshops seem well suited for online learning and teaching. The results show that the learning goals were achieved, that new ideas were created and stakeholder expectations reflected and challenged. In individual cases, the lack of on-site knowledge led to mistakes though, and online group work had different group dynamics  than  in-person  negotiations.  Vocal  and  well-organised  students  seem  to  engage  even  more whereas quiet students more easily disengage, as seen in a bimodal distribution of participation grades in the online class. In conclusion, geodesign workshops may be recommended as an online method for teaching GIS and group work methods such as brainstorming, consensus building and stakeholder-role play but a hybrid format or new virtual field trip techniques are preferable when familiarizing students with the case study site. The teaching of group work methods as part of planning and design may be transferred from geodesign to teaching building information models, which is also an information-based digitally facilitated collaboration process.

      "Computational tree modeling is a rapidly developing field with the potential to revolutionize the way landscape architects design and manage urban environments. This technology allows for the creation of realistic and scientifically accurate digital representations of trees, which can be used for a variety of applications, including Visualization, Simulation, Predictive Modeling, and Interactive tools. /// The authors hypothesized that point cloud models of trees could be used to improve computational tree growth models. The authors suggest that the use of digital tree models can be used for climatebased performance calculations, such as the U.S. Forest Service Tree Carbon Calculator (USDA 2022). This and other tools allow calculation of carbon dioxide sequestration and aboveground biomass, critical factors in mitigating climate change. This would provide a valuable tool for responsibly determining future performance of urban street trees., /// 0.2522522473987502\n"
